## FAQ

#### What does “Zebra” mean?

[Click here.](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=define+zebra)

#### Is there a repo with name `zebra-private`?

Of course, and you will find octocats or dragons [there](https://github.com/orzFly/zebra). It depends.

#### What is a *Metarepo*?

We learnt this concept from [Bubble Dev Metarepo](https://github.com/bubble-dev/_).

> The *Metarepo* is a new concept that we are trying out to simplify the development process.
> Many of the projects are dependencies of each other, so we can iterate in all at the same time. ...
> So far, the *Metarepo* is working really well for us, but we are aware it might present a bit a learning curve.
> The upshot is that you don't have to worry about a project being moved in here, projects placed in here are the same as before and are being actively worked on, the reason they are being moved here is simpler logistics.
